    <configuration XML_version="1.2" description="Simulates the C64+ core, Megamodule (L1P Program Cache, L1D Data cache, L2 Unified Mapped RAM/Cache, L2 ROM), SCR, EDMA3CC, EDMATC(0-3), Timers(2), EMIFA, EMIFB, TCP, VCP, McBSP(2) and external memory. Does not model SRIO, EMAC, PCI, HPI, UTOPIA and I2C. This is a device cycle accurate configuration and hence useful for applications development and benchmarking at the device level. &#10; Note on other configurations for this processor: &#10; * For core level algorithm development / benchmarking, it is recommended to use the &quot;C64x+ CPU Cycle Accurate Simulator&quot; for faster simulations than the device configuration. &#10; * For Megamodule level algorithm development/ benchmarking, it is recommended to use the &quot;C64x+ Megamodule Cycle Accurate Simulator&quot;, as this will be faster than the device simulator.
